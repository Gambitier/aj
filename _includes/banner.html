         Hi, I’m your host, Akash Jadhav. I’m fascinated by the applications of Data science and Machine Learning. 
      My interests include learning different programming languages, Data science & Machine Learning. 
      I also have a mild interest in medical science and aerospace engineering.

      Besides, I love to play chess very much. That's why I decided to name my blog as TheGambitier's Blog, 
      the word 'Gambit' (in chess) is an opening move in which a player makes a sacrifice, 
      typically of a pawn, for the sake of a compensating advantage.I love playing in that style.

        So, I want to understand things clearly, and explain them well. I hpoe you will enjoy interesting (hope so!) blog posts.!!
