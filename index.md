			<h3>How to Visualize Your Data Using ggplot2</h3>
			<p>Plots are more informative when they relate or compare several things, and an enthralling plot relates several 			    variables without being distracting. I pay lots of attention to how many different variables I am representing 			     in a single plot, and whenever possible, I try to add more. I look for interactions in plots the same way that I 				look for interactions in statistical models.</p>
